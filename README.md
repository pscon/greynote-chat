This project was bootstrapped with [Vite React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Project setup

First, Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pscon/greynote-chat
```

Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app.ts`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Additional Information: API Keys

After you start the application, you will need to set up an additional `.env` file to store the required API keys. These API keys are necessary for the application to interact with The Chat Messaging API which is configured using Firebase.

### Obtaining API Keys

To obtain the Firebase API keys, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**

   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Add a new project and name it.

2. **Project Settings:**

   - In the project dashboard, go to Project settings.

3. **Configure Web App:**

   - Under "Your apps," add a web app.
   - Firebase will provide a code snippet.

4. **API Key:**
   - In the snippet, find the `apiKey` value â€“ that's your Firebase API key.

### .env File Setup

Create a `.env` file at the root folder of your project and add the following content:

```bash
VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```
